## Scope of Project

Chat server using websockets. Multiple clients can connect to the server. User can create room and other users can join same room. Messages sent in that room will be exclusive to room members. Users can download the chat history locally as a JSON file. Users interact with the chat server through UI. User will be able to remove itself from the chatroom.

## How to run
Users can clone the chat server on to their machine. Once downloaded they can open up the folder the chat server is in through a code editor. Users can start the server by running a glassfish server with the given configurations. Once the website has loaded, users can see UI elements used to chat, create rooms, etc. The first message the user sends will set their name and successive messages will be sent as texts to members of the current room.
